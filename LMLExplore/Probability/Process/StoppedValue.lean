# The value of a process at a possibly infinite time

A random time of a filtration indexed by `ℕ` takes values in `WithTop ℕ`. Mathlib's
`MeasureTheory.stoppedValue u τ` reads the process at `τ ω` where it is finite and takes an
arbitrary value where `τ ω = ⊤`. Anytime-valid inference needs a canonical value at infinity: the
value of a process at a possibly infinite stopping time is `u (τ ω) ω` where `τ ω` is finite and
`limsup (u · ω)` where it is infinite [RRLK; RLKR23, (1.2)]. For nonnegative supermartingales with
finite initial expectation, which converge almost surely, this is the almost sure limit, and
optional stopping holds at every stopping time with this convention.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.stoppedValueLimsup u τ`: the value of `u` at the random time `τ`, with
  `limsup (u · ω)` where `τ ω = ⊤`.

## Main statements

* `MeasureTheory.stoppedValueLimsup_of_eq_coe`, `MeasureTheory.stoppedValueLimsup_of_eq_top`: its
  values at finite and infinite times.
* `MeasureTheory.stoppedValueLimsup_eq_stoppedValue`: where `τ` is finite it agrees with Mathlib's
  `stoppedValue`.
* `MeasureTheory.tendsto_stoppedValueLimsup_min`: for a convergent process, the values at the
  truncated times `min τ N` converge to the value at `τ`.
* `MeasureTheory.measurable_stoppedValueLimsup`: it is measurable for measurable `u n` and `τ`.

`τ ω = n`, and `limsup (u · ω)` where `τ ω = ⊤` [RRLK; RLKR23, (1.2)]. Unlike Mathlib's
`stoppedValue`, its value at infinity is meaningful: for an almost surely convergent process it is
the limit. -/
