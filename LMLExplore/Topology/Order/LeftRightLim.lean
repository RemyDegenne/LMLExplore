# Semicontinuity of one-sided limits of antitone functions

The left limit `Function.leftLim f` of an antitone function `f` is upper semicontinuous: it is
the upper semicontinuous regularization of `f`, from which it differs only at the (countably
many) discontinuities of `f`. Replacing a p-to-e calibrator by its left limit is how one shows that
admissible calibrators are upper semicontinuous.

## Main statements

* `Antitone.upperSemicontinuous_leftLim`: the left limit of an antitone function is upper
  semicontinuous.
